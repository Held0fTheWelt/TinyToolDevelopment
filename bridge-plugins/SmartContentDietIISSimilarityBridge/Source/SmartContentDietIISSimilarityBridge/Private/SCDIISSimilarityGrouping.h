	 * cannot map back to assets. SelfAssetPath is always excluded from the peer
	 * scan. Returns true (and fills OutGroup with Semantic signal, bApproximate,
	 * Confidence = best peer score, and a rationale) only when at least one peer
	 * joins the self member; otherwise OutGroup is reset empty and it returns false.
