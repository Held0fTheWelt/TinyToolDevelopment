# IIS LLM Store Bridge Documentation

## Audience

This documentation is for teams that have both Internal Index Service and LLM Store installed and want IIS embedding jobs to use governed LLM Store embedding routes without relying on UCM.

In the current Tiny Tool Development stack, Unreal Capability Mesh (UCM) is the preferred cross-product integration layer. This bridge documentation remains useful for no-UCM projects and as a reference for narrow direct adapters.

## Documents

- [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md): install, enable, build, and verify the bridge.
- [Blueprint usage](BLUEPRINT_USAGE.md): Blueprint nodes, diagnostic graphs, and embedding smoke-test recipes.
- [Buyer guide](BUYER_GUIDE.md): who benefits from the bridge and where the product boundary sits.
- [Integration details](INTEGRATION.md): runtime architecture, interfaces, route flow, and boundaries.
- [Source overview](SOURCE_OVERVIEW.md): source file map, executor lifetime, and request/response mapping.
- [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md): common setup and runtime failures.
- [Release checklist](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md): checks before publishing or packaging this bridge.

## Boundary Summary

The bridge is intentionally small and does not replace UCM in projects that use the full Tiny Tool Development stack.

```text
Internal Index Service
  owns indexing and embedding job orchestration

IIS LLM Store Bridge
  owns request/response adaptation

LLM Store
  owns provider routing, models, governance, secrets, and fallbacks
```

No plugin silently bypasses another plugin's responsibility.
